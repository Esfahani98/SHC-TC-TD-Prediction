# prediction of thermal conductivity (TD), thermal diffusivity (TD) and speciﬁc heat capacity (SHC) of sedimentary rocks using petrophysical well logs.
Abstract

In this study, equations are developed that predict for synthetic sedimentary rocks (clastics,
carbonates and evapourates) thermal properties comprising thermal conductivity, speciﬁc heat
capacity and thermal diffusivity.
